Red Wine Quality Classification

This project uses the Red Wine Quality dataset to train and test three machine learning models: Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Neural Network. The goal is to classify wine samples based on physicochemical properties and evaluate model performance.

Features
